# cowboybike-strava-sync

This script will fetch Cowboy Bike trips and upload them to Strava.
If the extended details provided by the newest Cowboy firmware are present, the activity will display locations as well as power data.

## Configuration

Configuration is mostly done through environment variables.

Two files are required for authentication, they will be used to store your access and refresh tokens for Strava API and Cowboy.

For Cowboy, we can fully generate it with a login to the API. If the file does not exists, it will be created and then reused for subsequent requests.

For Strava, you need to create an Application following this guide : https://developers.strava.com/docs/authentication/
Don't forget to add the `activity:write` scope to your token request. When you finish the procedure, the last reply will be a json with this format

```
{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_at": 1636631250,
  "expires_in": 21600,
  "refresh_token": "XXX",
  "access_token": "XXX",
  "athlete": {
    "id": 44554207,
    "username": "samueldumont",
    ...
  }
}
```

Save this file at the `STRAVA_SECRET_FILE_LOCATION`. This will be refreshed if necessary and updated.

## Kubernetes

There are some sample kubernetes manifests that will allow you to run this sync as a cronjob. You just need to change the secrets and it will run every 15 minutes.
